# Little Node Browser

This is a very simple web browser written in Nodejs. It uses NodeGui to create the desktop app.

## GUI

Following tutorials like [this one](https://hibbard.eu/node-gui/) as well as the [docs](https://docs.nodegui.org/) made it easy to create the interface. The structure is very similar to a DOM with parents, children and siblings. The main difference was to set a layout to an element, and append the children to the layout.
